# Episodict
Replicated distributed dictionary thing implemented based on http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~agrawal/spring2011/ugrad/p70-fischer.pdf

Get it? The algorithm sacrifices serializability of operations for availability and efficiency. Non-serialized content is episodic. An episodically synchronized map. An EpisoDict. *[rimshot]*
